"""Wrapper so `opencode run` works when invoked non-interactively (no TTY).

Handles two environment quirks:
  1. opencode ignores the positional message unless it has a PTY -> run under `script`.
  2. opencode silently drops any prompt containing an em-dash (U+2014), en-dash,
     smart quotes, or ellipsis when run without a TTY -> sanitize to ASCII first.

Additionally, to make the Tether review gate reliable, when the prompt asks for a
verdict (contains "REVIEW:"), the wrapper retries up to 4 times until the model's
response actually contains a verdict line (REVIEW: APPROVE / REVIEW: REQUEST_CHANGES).
The verdict content is the model's genuine assessment; we only retry so it is emitted
in the parseable format Tether requires. For non-review (agent) prompts it retries
up to 3 times if opencode returns an empty/"please provide code" response.
